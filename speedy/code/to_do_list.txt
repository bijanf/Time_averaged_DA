@page issues Known issues

- Misalignment of common /DATE1/ in speedy might degrade performance:
  - When compiling speedy code, IBM xlf and ifort produce many messages like this:
    @verbatim Variable fday is misaligned.  This may affect the efficiency of the code. @endverbatim
  - Using gfortran 4.4.5 or newer this message can be eliminated with the flag -fno-align-commons.
- fortran executables using MPI have only worked when compiled with gfortran.
  - letkf ifort-compiled program gets stalled in run-time (apparently related to a linking problem).
  - mixed ifort-speedy/gfortran-letkf compiled systems gets stalled too.
- das-speedy is currently depending on das folder position!!
- cp command sometimes crashes without reason in met-fub computers giving the message:
  @verbatim cp: cannot stat `prior/007/1980113000_grid_sigma_Tanom.rst': Permission denied @endverbatim
  Therefore its usage is avoided in the code. 
- ctl title is lost in cdo netcdf conversion

@page devel To Do List
Done
- check test task (why so long??!!!!!) varity 0 ....done
- removing replot task. TEST!!!!! (git commit) ....done

Ongoing
- add obs_id half of t0max, t0min (thresholding)
  - the fortran file is common_obs_speedy.f90
- create offline1_run and offline2_run tasks as discussed with Walter 
  following Steiger
- change the initialization method and produce a new free run, which 
  should be statistically compared (mean state and spread) with the
  previous one
- copy the code in batch


- systematize error_reduction calculation -> error_reduction_regarding()
  - many reference runs should be possible
  - backwards compatibility should be guarantee (thesis plots) or
  - new batch and code version should be created (probably safer)
  - articulate config_free_run and config_assi_run
  
- Send run with thresholding!!!!!!
  
  why plotting is done still even with global_flag=no???
  


Urgent
- compare temperature limited trees against mixed ones
- check again skewness maps  
- try mixed growth-limitation regimes
- plot geopotential height
- go for pressure levels!!!
- plot averaging lenght dependency:  tau vs latitude should be nice
- Enable writing of spectrally filtered analysis fields (anal_f)
- remove spinup from stats
- is there adaptive inflation for speedy??
- is there any warning from get_env still??
- what about debug and optimized flags??
- plot inflation
- Plot update map

Important
- some titles in the report miss proper labeling
- make vertical and horizontal localization changeable from scripting level, add values to config
- refacture run_set varying averaging lenght and obs_operator
- tie doxygen doc creation to git commit (add commit task to das)
- Activate precipitation writing in speedy. 
- ensemble mean calculation program in pressure levels. free run pressure level mean state it is not available!!
- error calculation is better done in pressure level space
- #limit stacksize 150000  ?
- parse time_increment inputs
- Create Breitenmoser tree-ring network table
- Having the time averaged ensemble decomposition outside speedy would be cleaner and more readable.

Important but time consuming
- Add wind vector and pressure plots
- Compile with ifort (faster). 
- Test also plotting routines
- solve warning

        IF(AAMAX.EQ.0.) PAUSE 'singular'                                
  Warning: Deleted feature: PAUSE statement at (1)
- why PARTIAL OBSERVATIONAL DEPARTURE (anal) has less obs? due to screening of obs with too large observational departure.
- Improve estimator of hard drive requirements
- Develop estimator of computation time 
- unsuccesfull runs must be deleted automaticly
- obs programs confound blank station line with temperature obs
- Simple Fix to IDATE-IDAY forcing bug mkes the model unstable.

Interesting but not compelling
- Unify further speedy- and lorenz-das
- Switch to Speedy ver 41, 
  - Land and slab ocean models are available in this version
  - try to make Miyoshi's changes cleaner and more in accordance with speedy structure
- isolate .h files overwritten by update files
- Gregorian calendar Time increment function is very problematic seem to be too strict.
