/*! \page devel To Do List
Issues
- Currently Only L63_2s and L96_2s models structure is up to date.
- detailed stats make the code unstable or there is something strange in calc03 and 04
- code copies not automatically erased from data archive. Remove after Plotting??

Done

Ongoing

Urgent
- Fix reports
- add plotting and documentation to test
- Disable unused models: L96_2s_pf, L96_2s_mix
- add parset to report name

Important
- further dataset thinning
  - symbolic links in runs
  - crashing runs leave too much garbage: (i) error messages in logs and (ii) raw_data
  - only one default_config.sh and model_core.f90 per run_set_bunch are enough

Important but time consuming
- allow recalculation of a crashed run
- clean enviroment before running !!!
- why replot fix report?? plots need some time to appear??.
- add restat option
- get_config_file "config/successful_runs.cfg" in run set tools should be smarter

- Find apropriate infl scaling?? (sqrt-step-infl not elegant at all)
- add dataset analysis tasking (plot, docu and view) to das.sh??
  or create dataset.sh??
- add running dataset file flag?? would require signal catching mechanism
- set_par info is not in run_set_bunch config
  - add it to config? hmm no backwards compatible
- add -recursive flag??
- erase code copies after succesfull plotting
- reactivate Letkf (write letkf inflation factor and check it)
- reactivate diffs ( implement stat_ and plot_run_set_diffs for run_set_bunch???)
- move stat gathering to plotting phase so as to isolate ncl dependencies??? not needed now
- improve sampling and initialization (around nature run) 
- allow one run_set from a bunch to be relaunch  
- parse model-obs operator combination
- solve warnings in netlib.f90
- unify my_* commands 
- all waits should be strict in principle??
- speed up test removal
- nc is not a good variable name for model component size.

Interesting but not compelling
- Implement sebastian model (rk4 seems not to be applicable)
- separate free/assi integer/real parameters elegantly 
- make funct_opening and _closing dependent on debug or verbosity.
- make random sequences reproducible?
- test forcing consistency (only for non-autonomous models:lorenz_1s_pf)
