Features:
- Diagnostic statistics are now model dependent (Fmean or Xsel)
- surfaces cycle-lengt vs inflation were always generated to make sure results do not depend in a particular value.
- State Standard deviation reduction is calculated with reference to nature run
- cycle-wise inflation used for the whole batch
- model exploration sequence:
  single_runs
  surface_Taver_mode-tied_vs_infl__by_loc_radius (for spatially extended models)
  surface_Taver_mode-tied_vs_infl__by_update_mode__obs_operator-plus
  surface_Taver_mode-tied_vs_sat_level__by_update_mode__obs_operator
  line_Taver_mode-tied__by_update_mode__obs_operator
  surface_Taver_length_vs_cycle_length__by_update_mode__obs_operator


__L63_2s model__

Using 40 ensemble members
- statistical noise was obviously reduced and the 
- surface and line plots remain quite similar to the ones with a 20 members ensemble
  
- Time-augmented approach? should improve as it is subject to higher statistical noise (Larger state with equal # of obs)
Did Augm get better??? 



wait for soroban enso line plot



Pena & Kalnay configs (uncoupled, extratropical_Ocen_atm_strong_coupling, extratropical_Ocen_atm_weak_coupling, weather_convection, and enso) showed very similar performance for Hakim and Augm1 updates. Enso config showed the biggest differeneces, where Augm1 update slighly outperforms Hakim update, and vls_0 operator performs most poorly.


For the enso-c config family (S=1.0, k1=-11.0, c=cz=variable) for the runs with c= 0.25,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.55 Hakim approach had very bad time. Fast component's error and spread rapidly grow with Taver length while Augm1 approach remains stable.
For this parameter area 
- fast component atractor shrinks a lot a become much smaller in amplitude than the slow component one.
- Slow-fast correlations become important ~ 0.5
- Slow-fast spectrum become similar


wait for long single runs in tux04



Among the TÃ¶dler et al coupling configurations for shallow-deep soil layers (shallow-deep_soil_mid_coupling, shallow-deep_soil_strong_coupling, shallow-deep_soil_weak_coupling) the mid and strong coupling ones also showed this filter divergence for Hakim update.


__L96_2s model__
All the configs showed a very similar picture
Augm1 update slighly outperforms Hakim update, and vls_0 operator
 
preliminary line plot for h1.0-b4.0 show hakim update divergence for but maybe it is due to bad tunning
  
  
__L96_2s_mix__
More Through tunning showed that the problematic sqrt-shape of the optimum infl factor happens for large localization radii.
For loc_radius=2 the optimum infl value is nearly constant.

Very preliminar surface plots show quite similar performance for differenet updates and normal obs. operator diffreneces 

link=0.2 line plot have mysteriusly completely crashed !!
send it in tux04



Open questions
- Reducing time step for L96_2s_mix ( Filter divergence should ameliorate)????
- saturation sensitivity

__Issues__
- State Standard deviation reduction was erroneously calculated with reference to the free ensemble run and then it present high negative values (~ -500%)
- Fmean statistic was used for all the model, however for L63 and L63_2s models this 
is not strictly proper, since their variables have diffrent amplitudes.

L63
----
- Inflation very easy to tune, step/cycle-wise inflations work almost the same.
- Hakim update has more spread in general. Augm{1,2} slightly better forecasts, hakim Taver analysis sligly better.
- Hakim update much more unstable for longTaver-frequentObs.


L63_2s
------
- Slow component statistics too noisy for 10000 and even 50000 assi. cycles. Runs with 200.000 assi. cycles showed a decently clear picture.
- step-wise (infl_step = infl_cycle**(1.0d0/cycle_steps)) inflation works slightly better for all update approaches (perhaps due to the strong non-linearity)
- Optimal infl_cycle value increases with cycle length. In particular, there is an scary no-skill zone in the right-lower corner of cycle-lenght vs Infl_cycle surfaces.
- sqrt infl scaling (infl_enkf = (infl_enkf*SQRT(cycle_steps-1.0d0)) + 1.0d0) appears to make easier inflation setting, however is not elegant at all.


Configurations:  

__uncoupled__
- too low infl/no-skill area if very big. In other to avoid it, selected inflation value for constant infl_cycle line study was rather high (1.08)


__extratropical_Ocen_atm_strong_coupling__
- too low infl/no-skill area if smaller than the uncoupled model one. Const. Infl_cycle=1.04 is enough to avoid it however for the sake of comparability Infl_cycle was also set tp 1.08.
- Forecast
  - best fast forecast by Augm1,2 Vsl0 !! (maybe Non-linear obs. op. reatins info of the inst. variable)
  - best slow forecast by Hakim but still too noisy.
- Analysis
  - best Taver slow & fast analysis by Hakim sum,vsl0,vsl1
  - best Insta fast analysis by Augm1,2 Vsl0 !!
  - worst slow analysis and forecast for Augm1,2/plus (~polution of inst vars by assimilating purely taver obs)
  
__enso__


__semienso1__
- . 

L96_2s_mix
----------

__L96_2s_mix-link = 0.2__
Optimum inflation seems to increase with Observation period (~ square root dependence). Localization-inflation convergence zone is also moving with Observation period. Thus if infl is constant regarding obs. period, the filter tunning for Taver-tied line experiments becomes hard (it is not possible to avoid divergence)

__L96_2s_mix-link = 0.0__
Same square root dependence on the optimum infl as link=0.2
Including this square root dependence in the selection of the infl factor seems to estabilize the filter


Augm2 update has shown so far the same performance as Augm1 update. It is expensive so it will not further tested.
