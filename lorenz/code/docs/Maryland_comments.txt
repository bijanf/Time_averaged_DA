__Andrew Majda__
- L96 fast-fast Model doesn't resemble enough atmosphere-land interaction. 

__Jeff Anderson__
- Atmosphere-land exp. vslite must not pose obs. period scaling problems due to the time average.
- State Augmentation might be helpful (Recommended Tarantola book).
  - State Augmentation with observations Looks just like repetition. Why better?

- Gaussian anamorfosis might be helpful.
  It has been useful to assimilate bounded quantities:
  - Lien, Kalnay & Miyoshi 2013 - Global Precipitation using Speedy
  - Nielsen-Gammon - Inverse hyperbolic tangent transform for there are lower or upper bounds (haven't found references).
  - Simon and Bertino 2009 - Coupled Ecosystem model
  - Sch√∂niger et al 2012 - hydraulic tomography

  semilog, gaussian, Inverse hyperbolic tangent... What's the difference? any book on that? Tarantola.
  
  Is it worth the effort?

__Kayo Ide__
- Would be interesting to use a linear, analitically solvable model.
- Enkf and EnKBF results should be equivalent for the linear obs. operator.
  - An square root filter would be more comparable to my deterministic EnKBF?
