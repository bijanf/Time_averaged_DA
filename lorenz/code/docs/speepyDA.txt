\page speepyDA SPEEDY-DA intro

The DAS (Data Assimilation system) allows to perform instantaneous and 
time-averaged kalman filtering for speedy model.
@note This code is based on the code [SpeedyLetkf](http://code.google.com/p/miyoshi/wiki/SpeedyLetkf) written by Takemasa Miyoshi. 
Scripts were completely rewritten and and speedy-LETKF interface considerably changed.

@section sec1 Instructions
- First of all, go to code folder and execute:
  - $ . das_initialize.sh (or)
  - $ source das_initialize.sh
- Afterwards, you can use the different system functions:
  - Simulation launcher to create new simulation datasets:
    - $ das_compute.sh (or)
    - $ nohup das_compute.sh & (in the background allowing to close the terminal)
  - System test (should be run after every potentially harmfull code change).
    - $ das_test 
  - Documentation creator:
    - $ create_doxygen_doc.sh
  - Lower level functions
    - $ ...

@attention Commands above only work if executed from the folder "code"

@section versioning Versioning commands
